This slurry is then fed into spray driers to form uniform granules ready for compaction. These granules are then shaped to form the bisque or green body. This can be glazed or left unglazed depending on its intended use. The green ceramic body is fired at high temperatures, resulting in a hard body. Ceramic floor tiles are largely used as interior and exterior floor coverings. Interior applications include bathrooms, kitchens, living rooms, halls, balconies, etc. Exterior applications can be in public buildings, commercial and industrial areas, swimming pools, and façades, etc. For interior applications, floor tiles should be selected regarding the technical specifications such as PEI value, hardness, stain resistance, chemical resistance, and easy cleaning, if they are to be used in the interiors of a residence. The tiles selected for exteriors should be frost-resistant and have low water absorbency.

Kaleseramik Wall tiles are primarily made of kaolin and clay, but they also include other raw materials such as marble, frit, dolomite, bentonite and quartz.

This slurry is then fed into spray driers to form uniform granules ready for compaction. These granules are then shaped to form the bisque or green body. This can be glazed or left unglazed depending on its intended use. The green ceramic body is fired at high temperatures, resulting in a hard body. Kaleseramik Wall Tiles are largely used as interior and exterior wall coverings. Interior applications are mainly in bathrooms and kitchens in residential applications while the exterior applications can include swimming pools, façades, commercial and industrial applications etc. For interior applications, ceramic wall tiles should be selected regarding the technical specifications such as PEI value, hardness, stain resistance, chemical resistance and easy cleaning, if they are to be used in the interiors of a residence. The tiles selected for exteriors should be frost resistant and have low water absorbency. For outdoor uses they normally have less than 3% water absorption but for internal applications this might rise to 16%.

The products obtained are presented in the form of a ""mineral wool mattress"" composed of a flexible airy structure. Thanks to their intertwined structure, mineral wools (glass wool or stone wool) are porous materials which trap air, thus providing an insulation solution. The porous and elastic structure of the mineral wool also absorbs aerial noise, impact sounds, and enables acoustic correction inside buildings and premises. Finally, as they are based on naturally incombustible minerals, mineral wools are incombustible and do not propagate fire. Insulation with mineral wool (glass wool) is used in buildings and in industrial installations, ensuring a high level of comfort, reducing energy costs, reducing carbon dioxide emissions, preventing heat loss, reducing sound pollution, and protecting houses and industrial installations from the risk of fire.

URSA manufactures glass wool using natural and plentiful raw materials (sand) or recycled materials (Cullet) in a fusion and fiber formation process. The products obtained are presented in the form of a ""mineral wool mattress"" composed of a flexible airy structure. Thanks to their intertwined structure, mineral wools (glass wool or stone wool) are porous materials which trap air, thus providing an insulation solution. The porous and elastic structure of the mineral wool also absorbs aerial noise, impact sounds and enables acoustic correction inside buildings and premises. Finally, as they are based on naturally incombustible minerals, mineral wools are incombustible and do not propagate fire. Insulation with mineral wool (glass wool) is used in buildings and in industrial installations. It ensures a high level of comfort, reduces energy costs, reduces carbon dioxide emissions (CO2), prevents heat loss through sloping roofs, walls, ceilings, pipes, and boilers, reduces sound pollution and protects houses and industrial installations from the risk of fire. The service life of a glass wool product is like that of a building, as it is a component of that installation (often established at 50 years).

When the vehicle slows down before coming to a halt, the crankshaft starter generator converts the generated brake energy into electrical energy. In the UltraCaps, the electrical energy is stored electrostatically, meaning without chemical processes as with conventional batteries. While the vehicle is at standstill, the combustion engine is turned off and the UltraCap accumulator takes over the supply of the vehicle electrical system for all functions (e.g. opening and closing of the doors, operation of the interior lighting and ventilation). Once driving off again, the crankshaft starter generator uses the available energy from the UltraCap capacitors to start the combustion engine. In addition, the crankshaft starter generator can use excess stored energy to act as an additional hybrid drive and thereby take some of the load off the combustion engine.",The International EPD® System,,www.environdec.com:library:epd7586.pdf,,EPD,3,4,,,,吴宇森,,,,2024-07-30 17:27:34.291615,
