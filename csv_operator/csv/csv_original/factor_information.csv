THIOVER sealants are produced in different types to suit the individual requirements of the operator and of the equipment in use. THIOVER sealants are totally solvent-free and can be used to produce both double and triple-glazed IG units. They can be used at any latitude, because they adapt to all weather conditions during window installation. THIOVER sealants conform to the most advanced criteria for eco-compatibility and contain no heavy metals or other harmful components. THIOVER offers excellent performance in terms of thermal insulation, superior mechanical properties, and extremely low permeability to water vapor and gas. Thanks to their high chemical resistance, THIOVER sealants are compatible with all types of IG unit components. Using the THIOVER range of products in an insulating glass unit ensures excellent resistance to water and stress along the edges of the unit. Moreover, with its outstanding mechanical performance, high tensile strength, and good springback, this range of products maintains superior protection for primary sealing. The THIOVER range of sealants is designed to perform as a gas barrier (low vapor and gas diffusion), a moisture barrier (resistance to water in liquid or gaseous form), and also to provide chemical fogging resistance and structural bonding of the total unit. Thanks to these features, THIOVER contributes to achieving long-term durability of the IG unit and a high level of thermal performance by maintaining the seal and keeping the gases at optimum levels. This means extending the lifetime of windows and providing more comfortable indoor temperatures.",The International EPD® System,,https://www.environdec.com/library/epd13059,,EPD,3,4,,,,吴宇森,,,,2024-08-01 16:45:00.236557,

They feature minimal permeability to water vapor and gases, high resistance to UV aging, excellent adhesion to glass, aluminium, galvanized steel, and stainless steel. They come in different colors to facilitate structural matching. Using the BUTYLVER range of products in an insulating glass unit provides a high level of moisture vapor migration resistance, and controls and minimizes gas and solvent migration into the IG unit’s sealed space. It also acts as a permanent hermetic barrier to the permeation of inert gases (for example, argon) when gases are used in the sealed space of the IG unit. BUTYLVER is designed to fill the space between the sides of the spacer and the faces of the two or three glass panes, and to develop adequate adhesion to the surfaces of both. It has movement capability so as not to fail due to limited differential movement that may occur between the spacer and the glass light. Thanks to these features, BUTYLVER contributes to limiting the formation of internal condensation, achieving a longer lifetime of the window system, increasing thermal performance of the window, and energy efficiency in any season.",The International EPD® System,,https://www.environdec.com/library/epd13054,,EPD,3,4,,,,吴宇森,,,,2024-08-01 16:46:35.097471,

In this process, a mixture of raw materials (oxides and metal salts) undergoes a calcination reaction at high temperatures, forming a specific crystalline matrix. The chemical composition of inorganic pigments is usually expressed as a combination of metal oxides, although these oxides are only used as raw materials, since they are not present once the inorganic pigment has been manufactured. During the calcination process, the raw materials are completely consumed. The resulting inorganic pigment forms a stable crystalline structure. The stability of their crystalline structure determines the intrinsic properties and behavior of inorganic pigments. In general, inorganic pigments are not very soluble and have very low reactivity. These substances are used in high-temperature applications due to their extreme durability, which offers light fastness and weather stability. Pigments are usually in powder form and are marketed with a defined grain size distribution depending on the decorative effects to be achieved. The uses and applications for which inorganic pigments are intended cover a wide range, from ceramic use (the most common) to more specific uses focused on industrial sectors such as flat and/or hollow glass decoration, tableware, construction, automotive, plastics, galvanizing/glazing of metal surfaces, and traditional and artistic ceramics.",The International EPD® System,,https://www.environdec.com/library/epd15446,,EPD,3,4,,,,吴宇森,,,,2024-08-01 17:41:57.140293,

In baking decoration processes, inkjet inks undergo a chemical transformation in which the solvent mixture is burned off, leaving the pigment permanently fixed on the surface to which it is applied. This process gives the ink remarkable high temperature resistance and long-term durability. The uses and applications for which digital inkjet inks are intended cover a wide range, from ceramic use (the most common) to more specific uses focused on industrial sectors such as flat and/or hollow glass decoration, textiles, tableware, automotive, construction, paper, wood, galvanized/glazed metal surfaces, and traditional and artistic ceramics. Digital inkjet inks for the ceramic industry represent one of the most important innovations in this industrial sector. They are specifically formulated for application with digital ceramic printers.

The molten mass is rapidly cooled with air or water, giving rise to a glassy mass called frit. Consequently, frits have a glassy structure, formed by structural units that do not repeat at regular distances. From the point of view of industrial processes for the manufacture of ceramic floor and wall tiles, frits are elaborated raw materials used to prepare engobes, glazes, and inks, providing a series of properties that improve the appearance and functionality of ceramic tiles. They provide properties such as wear resistance, impermeability, hardness, and the ability to create a decorative surface. The uses and applications for which frits are intended cover a wide range, from ceramic use (the most common) to more specific uses focused on industrial sectors such as the manufacture of flat and/or hollow glass, photovoltaic, medical, electronics, construction, automotive, galvanizing/glazing of metal surfaces, and traditional and artistic ceramics.

Some of the hot-rolled coils produced at our hot-rolling plants are sold as finished products while others are used as intermediary materials for cold-rolled or electrical steel production, thus being reprocessed into high value-added products. Hot-rolled steel products are widely used in many different industries due to their high strength as well as good weldability, machinability, and corrosion resistance.

High carbon steel is used where greater strength is required and this high strength is obtained through final heat treatment. There are two product groups: high carbon steel products with carbon content of more than 0.30wt.% or those with added alloy elements such as Mn, Cr, Mo, B, and Ni with carbon content of more than 0.15wt.%. The final specified physical properties of high carbon steel are achieved mostly through the process of hot rolling, pickling, cold rolling, and annealing. Final heat treatment is performed after the steel is processed and made into parts. High carbon steel can be broadly categorized into high carbon steel for machine structures, high carbon steel for tools, and construction products.
