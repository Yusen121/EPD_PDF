The asphalt mixtures that can be produced at the declared plant include hot mix asphalt (HMA), warm mix asphalt (WMA), soft asphalt (SA), and cold asphalt. These mixtures are grouped by their application in the pavement and can be manufactured for asphalt concrete (AC) for surface $(\mathsf{V})$, binder (A), base (P), and surface-base (PD) layers, stone mastic asphalt (SMA), noise-resistant (TM), and for traffic loads—light (L), normal (N), and heavy (S). Mixtures can be produced with paving grade (PG) bitumen or polymer-modified bitumen (PMB) and with reclaimed asphalt (RA) or without.

The main components in asphalt mixtures are coarse and fine aggregates, filler, and bitumen. Other materials and additives are added to ensure the durability of the layers, their content varying depending on the asphalt mixture type. These include cellulose fiber, which normally constitutes $0.3\%$ of mineral aggregates' weight. Reclaimed asphalt is added to asphalt mixtures to replace virgin aggregates and virgin bitumen.

At the plant, the manufacture of asphalt mixture is managed from the on-site control room. Aggregates, which are purchased and transported from external suppliers, are stored in open stockpiles of different fractions (e.g., 2/5, 5/8, 8/11, etc.). Fine aggregates and RA are stored in covered stockpiles (e.g., 0/2, RA, etc.). The aggregates in an individual stockpile are hauled with a front loader to a cold feed bin of the asphalt plant, then together with the other aggregate fractions of a given mix formulation (recipe) are transported further by a conveyor belt running below the bins. The mixed aggregates enter a rotating dryer drum, where the materials are dried and heated to the required temperature. The heated material continues to an elevator and is further transported up to the batch tower. Then dry and hot aggregates are screened and separated according to particle size and put into a weight hopper. The dry aggregates are mixed with bitumen, filler, fibers, and other additives in the mixing chamber. When a homogeneous asphalt mixture is obtained, it is transferred with a skip hoist to an insulated storage silo before being retrieved by a truck.

The emissions (i.e., polyaromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) generated in the dryer drum depend on production temperatures, fuel type, amount, and type of techniques used for adding RA. In this plant, RA is added without preheating (cold feed) so PAHs content is minimal, and all emissions created at the drying drum or at the top of the batch tower are transported for filtering at the collector.",The International EPD® System,,www.environdec.com:library:epd14655,,EPD,3,4,,,,吴宇森,,,,2024-09-01 22:04:58.063285,
