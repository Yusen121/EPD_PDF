The core layer adopts microcellular foaming technology with a variety of recycled polyolefin mixing systems, while the outer surface layer is made of modified HDPE as the main material. The products are extruded through the integration of co-extruding technology, featuring surface aging-resistance, anti-bacteria, anti-mould, and high bonding strength. The surface of the product uses original imitation wood color mixing technology and surface wood texture processing technology, presenting a high simulation of natural wood texture. The products are primarily used in construction, furniture, packaging, art, and other fields, with stable structure, lightweight, high strength, high internal bonding strength, strong nail holding power, and suitability for various handmade art processing and carving. The main material, HDPE recycled plastic, has a durability of not less than 25 years and can be recycled and crushed for 100% secondary use at the end of the product life cycle.

The production technology of tiles is dry pressing. The required composition is blended with water to form slurry. This slurry is then fed into spray driers to form uniform granules ready for compaction. These granules are then shaped to form the green body. The formed green body may then be glazed if required. The green ceramic body is fired at high temperatures, resulting in a hard body. The Kale porcelain tiles come in glazed and non-glazed porcelain tiles with non-glazed matt, glossy, or anti-slip surface options, in the dimensions of 20×20 cm, 30×30 cm, 40×40 cm, 30×60 cm, 60×60 cm, and 60×120 cm, allowing the designer to meet the requirements of projects, thanks to the superior technical characteristics, as well as colors and patterns.

Through the modification technology of the functional surface layer and the development of special adhesives, it achieves a plastic-clad metal profile with high weather resistance, high strength, and high adhesion. The product combines a polymer material cladding on the surface of aluminium alloy, achieving superior thermal insulation effects while solving the bottleneck of aluminium alloy in door and window filling thermal insulation and the need for partition processing. It also enhances the service life of aluminium alloy, extending its product life to over 25 years. The outer surface layer is an independently developed high weather-resistant functional polymer wood-like material, breaking through from the field of wood-plastic to metal materials, thereby expanding the application end of the material technology beyond the wood-plastic single industry.
