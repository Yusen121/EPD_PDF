Specifically the family company was established in 1932, when brothers Alfons and Karl Knauf secured the mining  rights to gypsum deposits in the Schengen community (Obermosel) in Germany. Courage, determination, and busi- ness savy were the reasons that only a year later Knauf established its first gypsum factory in Perl (Moselle) – laying  the foundation for what would later be the Knauf Group.  

The story of the company in Turkey began in 1989, as Biltepe AŞ, starting production in Ankara plant as the first gy- psum board factory of Turkey. In the second half of 1997, the firm engaged in a merger with Knauf, a world leader in  this field. From 2000 on, the investments proceeded under  $\mathtt{100\%}$  Knauf ownership. That very year also marked the  opening of the second gypsum board factory in İzmit, Turkey, followed by a third plant again in İzmit. One of the largest  plants of Europe, Knauf’s fourth plant in Turkey, the Ahiboz, Ankara factory began production in 2009.
