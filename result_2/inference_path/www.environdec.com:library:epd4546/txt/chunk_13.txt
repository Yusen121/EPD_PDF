# C3 - Waste Processing  

It is assumed that gypsum products will be  $\mathtt{100\%}$  landfilled after its life cycle, thus the environmental impact of this module  is set to be zero.  

# C4 - Disposal  

All plasters end up at construction and demolition waste landfills as their final fate and modelled as such in the LCA.  

# D - Benefits  

No potential benefits of recycling and re-use were taken into account. Only the benefit due to the recycling of the packaging  has been calculated.
