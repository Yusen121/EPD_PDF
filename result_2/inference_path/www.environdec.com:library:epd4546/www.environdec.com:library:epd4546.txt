This EPD covers multiple products, based on worst-case results.  

# How to read this EPD?  

An Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) is an ISO Type III Environmental Declaration based on ISO 14025  standard. An EPD transparently reports the environmental performance of products or services from a lifecycle  perspective. The preparation of an EPD includes different stages, from acquiring raw materials to the end of life  of the final product/service. EPDs are based on international standards and consider the entire value chain.  Additionally, EPD is a third-party verified document. This EPD includes several sections described below.  

# 1. General and Program Information  

The first part of an EPD has information about the name of the manufacturer and product/service and other  general information such as the validity and expiration dates of the document, the name of the program operator,  geographical scope, etc. The second page states the standards followed and gives information about the program  operator, third-party verifier, etc. The followed Product Category Rule (PCR) is indicated on the second page.  

# 2. Company and Product/Service Information  

Information about the company and the investigated product is given in this section. It summarizes the  characteristics of the product provided by the manufacturer. It also includes information about the product such  as product composition and packaging.  

# 3. LCA Information  

LCA information is one of the most important parts of the EPD as it describes the functional/ declared unit, time  representative ness of the study, database(s) and LCA software, along with system boundaries.  

The table presented in this part has columns for each stage in the life cycle. The considered stages are marked ‘X’  whereas the ones that are not declared are labeled as ‘ND’. Not all EPDs consider the full life cycle assessment for a  product’s entire life stages. The ‘System Boundary’ page is also the place where one can find detailed information  about the stages and the assumptions made.  

# 4. LCA Results  

The results of the Life Cycle Assessment analysis are presented in table format. The first column in each table  indicates the name of the impact category and their measurement units are presented in the second column.  These tables show an amount at each life cycle stage to see the impact of different indicators on different stages.  Each impact can be understood as what is released through the production of the declared unit of the material—in  this case, $\mathtt{1}\,\mathtt{m}^{\mathtt{2}}$  plasterboard production. The benefits of reuse/recycling of the declared product is reflected in this  section.  

The first impact in the table is global warming potential (GWP), which shows how much  $\complement_{2}$ is released at each    stage. Other impacts include eutrophication potential, acidification potential, ozone layer depletion, land use  related impacts, etc. The second table provides results for resource use and the third table is about the waste  produced during the production. The fourth and final table shows the results for the GWP-GHG indicator, which  is almost equivalent to the GWP-Total indicator mentioned previously. The only difference is that this indicator  excludes the biogenic carbon content by following a certain methodology.

EPDs within the same product category but registered in different EPD programmes may not be comparable. For two EPDs to be comparable,  they must be based on the same PCR (including the same version number) or be based on fully-aligned PCRs or versions of PCRs; cover products  with identical functions, technical performances and use (e.g. identical declared/functional units); have equivalent system boundaries and  descriptions of data; apply equivalent data quality requirements, methods of data collection, and allocation methods; apply identical cutoff  rules and impact assessment methods (including the same version of character is ation factors); have equivalent content declarations; and be  valid at the time of comparison.  

The EPD owner has the sole ownership, liability, and responsibility for the EPD. EPDs within the same product category but from different  programmes may not be comparable. EPDs of construction products may not be comparable if they do not comply with EN 15804.  

# About the Company  

Owner of the EPD:  Knauf A.Ş,  

Moment Beştepe / Beştepe Mah. 32. Cad. No:1 Kat:14 / No: 212-218 06560 Beştepe-Yenimahalle / Ankara  

Production Plants:  Ahiboz Plant (Ankara, Türkiye) and İzmit Plant (İzmit, Türkiye)  

Knauf is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of modern insulation materials, dry lining systems, plasters and  accessories, thermal insulation composite systems, paints, floor screed, floor systems, and construction equipment  and tools. With 250 production facilities and sales organizations in over 90 countries, 35000 employees worldwide,  the Knauf Group is without doubt one of the big players on the market – in Europe, the USA, South America, Russia,  Asia, Africa, and Australia.  

Specifically the family company was established in 1932, when brothers Alfons and Karl Knauf secured the mining  rights to gypsum deposits in the Schengen community (Obermosel) in Germany. Courage, determination, and busi- ness savy were the reasons that only a year later Knauf established its first gypsum factory in Perl (Moselle) – laying  the foundation for what would later be the Knauf Group.  

The story of the company in Turkey began in 1989, as Biltepe AŞ, starting production in Ankara plant as the first gy- psum board factory of Turkey. In the second half of 1997, the firm engaged in a merger with Knauf, a world leader in  this field. From 2000 on, the investments proceeded under  $\mathtt{100\%}$  Knauf ownership. That very year also marked the  opening of the second gypsum board factory in İzmit, Turkey, followed by a third plant again in İzmit. One of the largest  plants of Europe, Knauf’s fourth plant in Turkey, the Ahiboz, Ankara factory began production in 2009.  

The company have Quality Management System - ISO 9001, Occupational Health and Management System - ISO  45001, and Environmental Management System - ISO 14001.

# A1 - Raw Material Supply  

Production starts with raw materials mainly locally sourced, but some transported from other parts of the world. ‘Raw  material supply’ includes raw material extraction and pre-treatment processes before production. The stage covers the supply  (quarrying) and production of all components and additives. The use of electricity, fuel and auxiliary materials in production  is also taken into account.  

# A2 - Raw Material Transport  

Raw material transport from supplier to manufacturer is considered in raw material supply stage. The distances and routes  are calculated accordingly. Depending the manufacturer, locally supplied steel is transported via trucks and other supplies  come through seaway.  

![](images/8bf83d95817b49e3631c83302d75e1105b2937cc65ae9725e3b32ce0a6dc9f2b.jpg)  

# A3 - Manufacturing  

The components of Knauf plaster boards are suspended in silos in liquid phase and spread on a continuous sheet of board  liner (visible face, lower layer). The board liner is cut on the sides for edge shaping. The slurry is covered with a second sheet  of board liner (back surface) in the forming station and the edges of the visible face board liner are flipped upwards. On the  subsequent board liner the gypsum sets continuously and is dried in a multi-level drier to the permitted residual moisture  level. Drying is followed by the cutting of the boards to the desired lengths. (See also figure below)  

![](images/ed07c8731e2c96a4a58be6ced42e196d1cf5c61377d7fb32b6bbbcbe7a01fba9.jpg)  

Electric and natural gas are consumed during the manufacturing.

# A4 - Product Transport  

Product transport from manufacturer to customer is considered in product material supply stage. The distances and routes  are calculated accordingly. Depending the customer location, product is transported via trucks and other supplies come  through seaway.  

![](images/8e57ac9f994a4340491ec1b668ba416a375e6b1a68db924c56718829055ae932.jpg)  

# A5 - Installation  

During the installation of plasterboard, mortar, screws and steel profiles are generally used. The materials used depend  on the surface area and the application method. It can also be used directly. This study considered no material or energy  consumption during the usage phase.  

Additonally, the treatment of the packaging waste after the installation of the product has been considered in installation  stage.  It is presumed that all waste gypsum board st ripes  are disposed of in landfills.  

# B1-B7 - THE USE STAGE  

The use stage consist of seven stages as, B1: Use, B2: Maintenance, B3: Repair, B4: Replacement, B5: Refurbishment, B6:  Operational Energy Use, B7: Operational Water Use. No material and energy or technical operations are required during the  use stages until the end of life. Therefore, the product has no impact on this stage.  

# C1 - Deconstruction / Demolition  

The deconstruction and demolition of the product takes place with the demolition of the whole building. It is assumed that  energy for the binder is minor compared to the other materials of the building, thus the environmental impact of this module  is set to be zero.  

# C2 - Waste Transport  

A distance of 100 km by lorry 16-32 tonnes from construction/demolition sites to disposal sites has been chosen as a  conservative assumption.  

![](images/b1a6ea4f27a8ee113802fd7ecb958273d6dfd9a1e8fd29192c3d9bb634dae237.jpg)  

# C3 - Waste Processing  

It is assumed that gypsum products will be  $\mathtt{100\%}$  landfilled after its life cycle, thus the environmental impact of this module  is set to be zero.  

# C4 - Disposal  

All plasters end up at construction and demolition waste landfills as their final fate and modelled as such in the LCA.  

# D - Benefits  

No potential benefits of recycling and re-use were taken into account. Only the benefit due to the recycling of the packaging  has been calculated.

# LCA Modelling, Calculation And Data Quality  

The results of the LCA with the indicators as per EPD requirement are given in the LCA result tables. All energy calculations were obtained using Cumulative Energy Demand (LHV) methodology, while fresh water use is calculated with selected inventory flows in SimaPro according to the PCR. There are no co-product allocations within the LCA study underlying this  EPD. The regional energy datasets were used for all energy calculations. For LCA modelling and calculation, ecoinvent  database (v3.9.1) and SimaPro $(\lor\!9.5)$  LCA software were used. Characterization factors of EN 15804 reference package  based on EF 3.1 are utilized. Impact of infrastructure and capital goods are excluded from the analysis.

# LCA Results  

It is discouraging the use of the results of modules A1-A3 (A1-A5 for services) without considering the results of module  C. The estimated impact results are only relative statements, which do not indicate the endpoints of the impact categories,  exceeding threshold values, safety margins and/or risks.

GWP-GHG $=$  Global Warming Potential total excl. biogenic carbon following IPCC AR5 methodology. The indicator includes all greenhouse gases included in GWP-total but excludes biogenic carbon dioxide uptake and emissions and biogenic carbon stored in the product. The GWP-GHG indicator is identical to GWP-total except that the character is ation factor (CF) for biogenic CO2 is set to zero.
