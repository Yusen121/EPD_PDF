# Product Description  

Ceramic tiles are primarily made of kaolin, clay and feldspar, but  they also include other raw materials such as marble, frit, dolomite,  bentonite and quartz. The production technology of tiles is dry  pressing. The required composition is blended with water to form  uniform slurry. This slurry then fed into spray driers to form uniform  granules ready for compaction. These granules are then shaped to  form the bisque or green body. This can be glazed or left unglazed  depending on its intended use. The green ceramic body is fired at  high temperatures, resulting in a hard body.
