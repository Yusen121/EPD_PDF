# How To Read This EPD?  

An Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) is an ISO Type III  Environmental Declaration based on ISO 14025 standard. An EPD  transparently reports the environmental performance of products  or services from a lifecycle perspective. The preparation of an EPD  includes different stages, from acquiring raw materials to the end  of life of the final product/service. EPDs are based on international  standards and consider the entire value chain. Additionally,  EPD is  a third-party verified document . This EPD includes the following  sections described below.  

# 1. General and Program Information  

The first part of an EPD has information about the name of the  manufacturer and product/service and other general information  such as the validity and expiration dates of the document, the name  of the program operator, geographical scope, etc. The second page  states the standards followed and gives information about the  program operator, third-party verifier, etc. The followed Product  Category Rule (PCR) is indicated on the second page.  

# 2. Company and Product/Service Information  

Information about the company and the investigated product is  given in this section. It summarizes the characteristics of the product  provided by the manufacturer. It also includes information about  the product such as product composition and packaging.  

# 3. LCA Information  

Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) information is one of the most important  parts of the EPD as it describes the functional/declared unit, time  representative ness of the study, database(s) and LCA software,  along with system boundaries. The table presented in this part has  columns for each stage in the life cycle. The considered stages are  marked  $\mathbf{\acute{X}}^{\prime}$  whereas the ones that are not considered are labeled  as ‘NR’ (Not Relevant). Not all EPDs consider the full life cycle  assessment for a product’s entire life stages. The ‘System Boundary’  page is also the place where one can find detailed information about  the stages and the assumptions made.  

# 4. LCA Results  

The results of the LCA analysis are presented in table format. The  first column in each table indicates the name of the impact category  and their measurement units are presented in the second column.  These tables show an amount at each life cycle stage to see the  impact of different indicators on different stages. Each impact can  be understood as what is released through the production of the  declared unit of the material. The benefits of reuse/recycling of the  declared product are reflected in this section.  

The first impact in the table is global warming potential (GWP),  which shows how much  $\mathsf{C}\mathsf{O}_{2}$  is released at each stage. Other  impacts include eutrophication potential, acidification potential,  ozone layer depletion, land use related impacts, etc. The second  table provides results for resource use and the third table is about  the waste produced during production. The fourth and final table  shows the results for the GWP-GHG indicator, which is almost  equivalent to the GWP-Total indicator mentioned previously. The  only difference is that this indicator excludes the biogenic carbon  content by following a certain methodology.

# About Product  

# Product Description  

Ceramic tiles are primarily made of kaolin, clay and feldspar, but  they also include other raw materials such as marble, frit, dolomite,  bentonite and quartz. The production technology of tiles is dry  pressing. The required composition is blended with water to form  uniform slurry. This slurry then fed into spray driers to form uniform  granules ready for compaction. These granules are then shaped to  form the bisque or green body. This can be glazed or left unglazed  depending on its intended use. The green ceramic body is fired at  high temperatures, resulting in a hard body.

# Areas of Use  

Ceramic floor tiles are largely used as interior and exterior floor  coverings. Interior applications include bathrooms, kitchens, living  rooms, halls, balconies etc. Exterior applications can be in public  buildings, commercial and industrial areas, swimming pools and  façades etc. For interior applications, floor tiles should be selected  regarding the technical specifications such as PEI value, hardness,  stain resistance, chemical resistance and easy cleaning, if they are to  be used in the interiors of a residence. The tiles selected for exteriors  should be frost resistant and have low water absorbencymThe  numbers beside ceramic floor tiles indicate the abrasion resistance  of the ceramic surface according to Turkish and European Standard  TS-EN ISO 10545-7:  

Class-1: Suitable for walls and bedroom and bath-room floors. Class-2: Suitable for light traffic areas, such as the floors of a house. Class-3: Suitable for moderately heavy traffic floors such as in  entrances and corridors.  

Class-4: Suitable for heavy traffic area floors such as in restaurants,  stores, etc.  

Class-5: Suitable for floors subject to heavy foot traffic and abrasion,  such as in shops, hotels, restaurants, offices, schools, exhibition halls,  etc.

# Product Stage  

# Use Stage  

A1-A3:  Represents raw material supply which includes raw material  extraction and pre-treatment processes before production. A2 relevant to  raw material transportation to the plant and A3 refers to the impact occurs  from manufacturing process.  

![](images/ce3bdbab1a7780082f619edbc52b10eb73f494754dd5607805fb1b059d330add.jpg)  

# Construction Process Stage  

A4:  This stage is relevant to the transportation of the final product from the  factory gate to the customers.  

A5.  This stage includes the adhesive mortar and water usage in the  construction site. For  $1\;{\mathsf{m}}^{2}$  slab installation;  $3.3~\mathrm{kg}$  mortar and  $0.8~\mathsf{L}$  water  usage was assumed.  

B1:  Ceramic tile do not cause any emissions in the use stage because of the  inert feature. B2:  Usage of detergent containing stain remover or neutral lowsulphate and  rinsing with tap water after cleaning was assumed. $0.2\,\mathsf{m L}$  detergent and 0.1  L water use was assumed to wash $1\,\mathsf{m}^{2}$  ceramic tile. B3-B5:  Ceramic tile do not require any repairment during the use phase and  therefore no impacts should be declared. B6-B7:  Ceramic tile do not require any water and energy in the use phase and  therefore no impacts ocurred in this module.  

# End of Life Stage  

C1:  Deconstruction of ceramic at the end of their life is done manually. So no  impact occurs in this module.   C2:  Waste transport includes discarded ceramic tile and mortar to disposal  area. Distance from demolition site to inert landfill site for final disposal is  assumed as $50\,\,{\sf k m}$ . C3:  Environmental impacts generated during the crushing of discarded  ceramic tile before recycle or reuse. C4.  Disposal construction and demolition waste scenario is created separately  depending on the geographic location of the use phase. After domestic usage,  ceramic tile products end up at construction and demolition waste landfills  as their final fate and modelled as such in the LCA. D:  Inert filler benefits and recycling of packaging materials specified in the  disposal stage.  

# LCA Information  

# Functional / Declared Unit  

The declared unit is  $18.3\,\mathsf{k g}$  of  $1\,\mathsf{m}^{2}$  average ceramic floor tiles.  

# REACH Regulation  

No substances included in the Candidate List of Substances of Very  High Concern for authorization under the REACH regulations are  present in this product either above the threshold for registration  with the European Chemicals Agency or above $0.1\%$  (wt/wt)  

# System Boundary  

The system boundary covers A1 - A3 product stages referred as 

 ‘Raw material supply’, ‘Transport’ and ‘ Manufacturing’, A4 - A5 

 ‘Construction’, B1 - B7 ‘Use’ and C1 – C4 ‘End of life’ stages and  Module D ‘Benefits & Loads’.  

# Cut-off Rules  

For this LCA study, no cut-off criteria was applied.  

# Background Data  

For all LCA modelling and calculation, Ecoinvent database (v3.9) and  SimaPro (v9.5) LCA software were used.  

# Period Under Review  

The data used for LCA study concerns the year 2022.  

# LCA Modelling, Calculation and Data Quality  

The results of the LCA with the indicators as per EPD requirements  are given in the LCA result tables. All energy calculations were  obtained using Cumulative Energy Demand (LHV) methodology,  while freshwater use is calculated with selected inventory flows in  SimaPro according to the PCR. There are no co-product allocations  within the LCA study underlying this EPD. The regional energy  datasets were used for all energy calculations.  

# Allocations  

There are no co-products in the production of ceramic tile  manufactured by Kaleseramik. Hence, there was no need for  co-product allocation. Kaleseramik sources raw materials from  different l ocations across Turkey and other parts of the world and  by different means of transport (truck and ship). For this reason,  transport was allocated according to tonnages for almost all raw  materials bought by Kaleseramik. Kaleseramik manufactures  various ceramic tiles in the Company’s Çanakkale plant in Turkey.  Electricity and combined heat power (CHP) powered by natural gas  are used. Raw materials, transport, packaging, waste, and energy  consumption data were allocated for each product using related  production tonnages from Kaleseramik’s Çanakkale plant for the  average product.

( $\mathsf{X}=$  Module included, - $=$  Module not included)  

# LCA Results  

It is discouraging the use of the results of modules A1-A3 (A1-A5 for services) without considering the results of module C. The estimated impact  results are only relative statements, which do not indicate the endpoints of the impact categories, exceeding threshold values, safety margins and/or  risks.
