# Interpretation of results  

The environmental impact of DESSO EcoBase products should be considered over the whole life  cycle and beyond, including all module A-D. DESSO EcoBase consists of a novel recipe, specially  designed to enable post-consumer recycling on a high level, which means, for the same purpose and  without quality loss.  

The original EcoBase backing was introduced in 2010. Because of the relatively long service life-time  (10 years), the majority of current products are still in their first cycle, meaning that recycled content is  still very minimal and not included in the calculations.
