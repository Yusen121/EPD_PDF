# Resource recovery  

Module D has been considered for this study in order to evaluate the possible environmental benefits  obtainable through the re-use of secondary materials in other production cycles. Particularly, the  module clearly describes the benefits and the environmental charges deriving from reusable products  exiting from the system, such as secondary materials or secondary fuels.  

Three outlets have been considered:  

•   Yarn  •   DESSO EcoBase ®  backing  •   Others compounds  

PA6 yarn will be sent to Tarkett’s yarn supplier Aquafil for de polymerization and reuse in new carpet  yarns. This post-use material stream can be used for  $100\%$  and without quality loss for the production  of new carpet yarns.  

DESSO EcoBase ®  backing is  $100\%$  recyclable in Tarkett’s own production process. Post-use material  can be directly recovered in Tarkett’s production for the same purpose and avoids the production and  use of primary material.  

A small rest fraction is recycled in the cement industry. The chalk and ATH content substitutes primary  chalk, which is a raw material for the production of cement. Organic residues substitute primary fuel for  processing.
