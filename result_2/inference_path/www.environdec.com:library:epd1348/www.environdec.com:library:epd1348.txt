According to PCR 2019:14 v1.3.3 , several sets of results, reflecting different products, are not allowed  to be declared in the same EPD. However, similar products from a single or several manufacturing sites  covered by the same PCR and manufactured by the same company with the same major steps in the  core processes may be grouped and thereby included in the same EPD;  

The results of a worst case product (Topaz 70) will be declared in this EPD.  

The variation in GWP-GHG results for modules A1-C4 between included products and the declared  product goes from  $15-23\%$ .  

The components for  Topaz 70 are detailed here:

# Health, safety and environmental aspects during production  

Topaz 70 production site complies with the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System and the ISO  9001 Quality Management System.  

# Delivery and installation  

# Delivery  

The average distribution distance between the factory and the installation site is 1007 km. It has been  calculated considering the average distance between European countries where Tarkett is selling the  Topaz 70 products and the factory plant in Clervaux (luxembourg). The distribution is made by truck.  

# Installation  

The different parts of the flooring are cut to fit the surface to fit the surface to be covered and they are  arranged together so that they can fit perfectly between them on the floor .The different parts of the  flooring are glued on the subfloor then they are welded together.  

![](images/42fefb163cdfd69c40c02b1c70f60704cbe491b468f6c6d5c2240dc2659b52fa.jpg)  

# Waste  

During the installation approximately  $10\%$  of the flooring is lost as off-cuts. All flooring losses are sent  to recycling. Thanks to the ReStart program. Tarkett offers to all of its customer flooring installers a free  take-back system for installation off-cuts including equipment, logistics and recycling. This analysis  therefore considers a recycling scenario of the offcut.  

# Packaging  

$50\,\%$  of the packaging materials goes to incineration and $50\,\%$  goes to landfill  

# Use Stage  

# Reference Service Life (RSL)  

For this product, the stated RSL is 1 year. It should be noted, however, that the service life of a  Heteregenous polyvinyl chloride floor covering may vary depending on the amount and nature of floor  traffic and the type and frequency of maintenance. The manufacturer has provided this service life on  the basis of his experience of flooring manufacture and supply. This RSL is applicable as long as the  product use complies with that defined by ISO 14041 and ISO10874 in accordance with the product’s  classification.  The service lifetime recommended by Tarkett is 25 years .  

# Cleaning and maintenance  

Cleaning regime is based on traditional cleaning protocol integrating manual and mechanical  operations .  Depending on premises considered, these consumptions may vary. The considered  regime fits high traffic areas. The  maintenance scenario is :  

▪   Common maintenance : 2 times a week   ▪   Periodic maintenance : once every 2 weeks  ▪   Exceptionnal maintenance $\mathbf{:}\,\pmb{2}$  times a year

# Prevention of structural damage  

To avoid excessive wear, usage should be restricted to the stated areas of application as outlined by  the norm ISO 10874.  

# End of Life  

Environmental impacts of landfilling are presented in module C. Tarkett also modeled an alternative  scenario, incineration. The results can be found on page 17  

# Landfilling /L  

Landfilling waste is still a proheminent waste management scenario. This option is however not  recommanded by Tarkett. Environmental impacts of landfilling are presented in module  C/L .  

# Incineration with energy recovery /I  

Incineration with energy recovery is a rising waste management method in many of the countries in wich  Topaz 70 is sold. While Tarkett wishes to recycle  $100\%$  of products sold, incineration with energy  recovery is an alternative option if recycling is impossible. Environmental impacts of incineration with  energy recovery are presented in module  C/I  on page 17  

# Benefits and loads beyond system boundary  

# Landfilling /L  

Benefits accounted in this scenario exclusively come from installation offcuts recycling and are  presented in  D/L  

# Incineration with energy recovery /I  

Benefits from installation offcuts recycling and incineration energy recovery are calculated in  D/I  on page  17.  

# Results  

The estimated impact results are only relative statements, which do not  indicate the endpoints of the impact categories, exceeding threshold values,  safety margins and/or risks.  

Disclaimer :     The results of modules A1-A3  should not be used without  considering the results of module C.
