# Content information  

The content of declared asphalt mixtures is presented in table below. The asphalt mixtures have been  grouped based on the average mass of materials for determination of the impact categories.   In the table,  the composition of the asphalt mixture is presented in percentages and intervals depending on the type  of mixtures, as this is a company secret.  

The packaging of asphalt mixtures is negligible since after mixing the loose mixture is poured straight to  the trailer.  

The products do not contain any substances of very high concern (SVHC) according to REACH.
