The key assumptions in the LCA are:  

•   Asphalt composition:  The asphalt composition of each product is taken from Vilniaus Asphalt  plant of AB “Eurovia Lietuva” systems. These data are considered to be of high accuracy.  •   Site energy data:  When calculating the environmental efficiency of individual asphalt mixtures,  the energy used for drying aggregates was calculated for individual asphalt mixtures according  to the production temperature, assigning annual energy consumption equally to all products (by  mass).  •   Other site-related impacts  (site electricity use, fuel use for front loader equipment) have been  attributed to asphalt products based on their respective production volumes (in tonnes). This  approach assumes that the impacts are similar per tonne of asphalt product. Mass allocation is  considered the most reasonable approach to attributing generic site-related environmental  impacts to different products.  •   Road transports are assumed to be carried out by EURO 5 standard vehicles.  •   The polymer-modified bitumen  is set to Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene SBS.   •   Asphalt mixtures is  $100\,\%$  recyclable , in calculations for module D the recycling rate is set to  $90\%$  of reuse to produce a new asphalt mixture and $10\%$  recycling to unbound base layers. This  is based on specific data provided by ”Eurovia Lietuva” representatives. The assumption is  considered reasonable as the industry strives to recycle as much asphalt as possible due to  

both economical and environmental benefits. This end-of-life scenario is representative as one  of the most probable alternatives.  •   Asphalt mixture grouping.  The average results in the group have been obtained by modelling  each asphalt mixture to determine their environmental impact, and then the average  environmental impact per group has been determined and declared.
