# About Product  

# Product Description  

Kaleseramik produces 2200 varieties of wall tiles in 60 different  dimensions. Kaleseramik Wall tiles are primarily made of kaolin and  clay, but they also include other raw materials such as marble, frit,  dolomite, bentonite and quartz. The production technology of tiles  is dry pressing. The required composition is blended with water to  form uniform slurry. This slurry then fed into spray driers to form  uniform granules ready for compaction. These granules are then  shaped to form the bisque or green body. This can be glazed or left  unglazed depending on its intended use. The green ceramic body is  fired at high temperatures, resulting in a hard body.
