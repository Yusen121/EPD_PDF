# Areas of Use  

Kaleseramik Wall Tiles are largely used as interior and exterior wall  coverings. Interior applications are mainly in bathrooms and kitchens  in residential applications while the exterior applications can include  swimming pools, fa√ßades, commercial and industrial applications  etc. For interior applications, ceramic wall tiles should be selected  regarding the technical specifications such as PEI value, hardness,  stain resistance, chemical resistance and easy cleaning, if they are  to be used in the interiors of a residence. The tiles selected for  exteriors should be frost resistant and have low water absorbency.  For outdoor uses they normally have less than $3\%$  water absorption  but for internal applications this might rise to  $16\%$ . Depending on  the use, ceramic tiles might be glazed to control abrasion and slip  resistance.
