# Product information  

Product name:   Diamond Series  

# Product description:  

The product is a kind of aluminium plastic product, consisting of aluminium alloy profile as the main  "core layer" material, modified HDPE as the main "exterior cladding layer" material, and through the  modification technology of the functional surface layer and the development of special adhesives, it  achieves the plastic clad metal profile with high weather resistance, high strength and high adhesion.  The product is a polymer material cladding on the surface of aluminium alloy, which not only achieves  superior thermal insulation effect, but also solves the bottleneck of aluminium alloy in the door and  window filling thermal insulation, or the need for partition processing, etc., and also greatly enhances  the service life of aluminium alloy, and its product life can reach more than 25 years. The outer surface  layer of the product is the independently developed high weather-resistant functional polymer wood-like  material layer, which breaks through from the field of wood-plastic to the field of metal materials, and  makes the application end of the material technology break through the limitations of the wood-plastic  single industry. The density of the product is  $2.00\ {\mathsf{g}}/{\mathsf{c m}}^{3}$ . The performance of the product is shown in  the table below.

![](images/69e317daf236c7fd60a05a59040422283979b552d47fe4eb17ef4ac7c08d44bf.jpg)  
Figure 1 The main production process of studied product.  

Diamond series product is made of aluminium alloy profiles and modified HDPE as the main materials,  and the HDPE-based polymer material is externally wrapped on the surface of aluminium alloy using  high bonding adhesive. After the extrusion process for all products, then is the surface treatment and  cutting process to make the finished product and sent to packaging process.  

The GWP-GHG of electricity mix for Zhejiang province in this study is 0.807 kg CO 2  eq./kWh. Note that  the Guarantees of Origin market in China represents an extremely small proportion of production and  consumption, and therefore the consumption mix is effectively the same as the residual mix.  

Table 2. Electricity structure of the Zhejiang province and the dataset chosen for it

(1)  In the 2022 China Electricity Yearbook, the percentage of electricity from fossil fuel for each province is not specified.  A brief description of electricity from fossil fuel for the whole country is given in the yearbook, i.e. it covers coal, gas,  oil, biomass, and a small amount of unidentified sources for generating electricity. Based on the information in the  yearbook, i.e., electricity from hard coal accounts for more than  $80\%$  of the thermal power generation types, and  considering that China is a country where coal-fired power generation is the main source of thermal power generation,  the LCA practitioner (IVL) decide to use electricity from hard coal as  $100\%$  of the dataset selection for electricity from  fossil fuel in this study for modelling.  

# More information:  

Scenarios and additional technical information:  

   The product is manufactured in China, and the waste treatment of the waste generated during the  manufacturing process was included in the system boundary.  

   The product is sent to and used globally. For module A4, the longest shipping distance is applied  for the model as the conservative consideration, which is selling to the United States. The specific  data of the longest transportation information from the manufacturing plants to the overseas selling  destination is collected by the client, which is the specific data.  

   With regard to module A5, during the construction stage, the product requires some screws, which  are included in the study. The energy consumption of the construction, i.e., electricity, is included  in the study. Besides, according to the information provided by the client, the packaging of the  studied products is assumed to become to waste in this stage and is treated to end-of-life stage.    

    In module B, the product in this study do not generate emissions and consume energy and water  during the whole use phase, so the use phase environmental impact is deemed to be zero.  

   The modelling of module C1 is assumed that the consumption of additional materials and energy  used in the deconstruction stage for installation is zero. The  ${\mathcal{2}}4\%$  of the rest of the waste product  would be sent to C4 for disposal, and $76\%$  to material recycle according to the recycling data from  the International Aluminium Institute. For module C2, conservative assumptions have been made  that the waste product would be transported for $500\,{\mathsf{k m}}$  by truck. For the waste processing module  C3, disposal module C4, and module D (benefits and loads beyond the system boundary), the  generic data has been applied. Besides, it is assumed the waste products would be processed in  C3 with a $3.01\%$  mass loss.  

   Regarding the module D calculation, it should be noted that the product does not have post- consumer materials as the raw material. Meanwhile, this study does not consider the co-product  allocation in this project, so there is no co-product allocation issue for the module D calculation.  

# Allocation:  

Allocation rules for co-products are mentioned in the PCR. In this study, there are no co-products  produced. No co-product allocation has been applied in this study i.e. all burdens are allocated to the  final studied product. For the allocation of waste and module D calculation, this study strictly follows the  PCR.  

# Cut-off rules:  

The cut-off criteria established by the PCR is that data for elementary flows to and from the product  system contributing to a minimum of  $95\%$  of the declared environmental impacts shall be included (not  including processes that are explicitly outside the system boundary).  

This study strictly follows the cut-off rule. Raw materials with high environmental impacts were reserved  in calculation even though their mass is smaller than $5\%$  of the whole product. The cut-off rule is only  applied on auxiliary materials of the studied product. The total amount of cut-off materials in the product  system is fully below  $1\%$  and no high emission material is used for those materials. Besides, the  transportation of A3 manufacturing waste which are sent third-party for treatment is cut-off. The  sensitivity analysis is applied on the cut-off part to ensure the environmental impact of the cut-off part is  below $5\%$ .

At the time of data collection, no substance included in the Candidate List of Substances of Very High  Concern (SVHC) for authorization under the REACH Regulations is present in the products covered by  this LCA and EPD either above the threshold for registration with the European Chemicals Agency or  above $0.1\%$  (wt/wt).  

Depending on the PCR, in general, the production and end-of-life processes of infrastructure or capital  goods used in the product system should be excluded, unless there is evidence that they are relevant  in terms of their environmental impact, or when a generic LCI dataset includes infrastructure/capital  goods, and it is not possible, within reasonable effort, to subtract the data on infrastructure/capital goods  from this dataset (directly citation from section 4.3.2 of PCR 1.3.4). In this study, the infrastructure and  capital goods are not included in the LCA analysis since they are used plenty of times for several years  for the product manufacturing. According to the PCR, it should be excluded.  

All results in this LCA analysis are calculated by the EN  $15804{+}\mathsf{A}2$ .  The “EN 15804 reference package”  is calculated based on EF 3.1.  

# Results of the environmental performance indicators  

The estimated impact results are only relative statements which do not indicate the end points of the  impact categories, exceeding threshold values, safety margins or risks.  

All results are calculated on the declared unit, which is 1 tonne of the studied product in this study.
