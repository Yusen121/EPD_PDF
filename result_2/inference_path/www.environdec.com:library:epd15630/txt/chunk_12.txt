# Cut-off rules:  

The cut-off criteria established by the PCR is that data for elementary flows to and from the product  system contributing to a minimum of  $95\%$  of the declared environmental impacts shall be included (not  including processes that are explicitly outside the system boundary).  

This study strictly follows the cut-off rule. Raw materials with high environmental impacts were reserved  in calculation even though their mass is smaller than $5\%$  of the whole product. The cut-off rule is only  applied on auxiliary materials of the studied product. The total amount of cut-off materials in the product  system is fully below  $1\%$  and no high emission material is used for those materials. Besides, the  transportation of A3 manufacturing waste which are sent third-party for treatment is cut-off. The  sensitivity analysis is applied on the cut-off part to ensure the environmental impact of the cut-off part is  below $5\%$ .

At the time of data collection, no substance included in the Candidate List of Substances of Very High  Concern (SVHC) for authorization under the REACH Regulations is present in the products covered by  this LCA and EPD either above the threshold for registration with the European Chemicals Agency or  above $0.1\%$  (wt/wt).  

Depending on the PCR, in general, the production and end-of-life processes of infrastructure or capital  goods used in the product system should be excluded, unless there is evidence that they are relevant  in terms of their environmental impact, or when a generic LCI dataset includes infrastructure/capital  goods, and it is not possible, within reasonable effort, to subtract the data on infrastructure/capital goods  from this dataset (directly citation from section 4.3.2 of PCR 1.3.4). In this study, the infrastructure and  capital goods are not included in the LCA analysis since they are used plenty of times for several years  for the product manufacturing. According to the PCR, it should be excluded.  

All results in this LCA analysis are calculated by the EN  $15804{+}\mathsf{A}2$ .  The “EN 15804 reference package”  is calculated based on EF 3.1.
