# Product description:  

The product is a kind of aluminium plastic product, consisting of aluminium alloy profile as the main  "core layer" material, modified HDPE as the main "exterior cladding layer" material, and through the  modification technology of the functional surface layer and the development of special adhesives, it  achieves the plastic clad metal profile with high weather resistance, high strength and high adhesion.  The product is a polymer material cladding on the surface of aluminium alloy, which not only achieves  superior thermal insulation effect, but also solves the bottleneck of aluminium alloy in the door and  window filling thermal insulation, or the need for partition processing, etc., and also greatly enhances  the service life of aluminium alloy, and its product life can reach more than 25 years. The outer surface  layer of the product is the independently developed high weather-resistant functional polymer wood-like  material layer, which breaks through from the field of wood-plastic to the field of metal materials, and  makes the application end of the material technology break through the limitations of the wood-plastic  single industry. The density of the product is  $2.00\ {\mathsf{g}}/{\mathsf{c m}}^{3}$ . The performance of the product is shown in  the table below.
