# 4. LCA Results  

The results of the LCA analysis are presented in table format. The  first column in each table indicates the name of the impact category  and their measurement units are presented in the second column.  These tables show an amount at each life cycle stage to see the  impact of different indicators on different stages. Each impact can  be understood as what is released through the production of the  declared unit of the material. The benefits of reuse/recycling of the  declared product are reflected in this section.  

The first impact in the table is global warming potential (GWP),  which shows how much  $\mathsf{C}\mathsf{O}_{2}$  is released at each stage. Other  impacts include eutrophication potential, acidification potential,  ozone layer depletion, land use related impacts, etc. The second  table provides results for resource use and the third table is about  the waste produced during production. The fourth and final table  shows the results for the GWP-GHG indicator, which is almost  equivalent to the GWP-Total indicator mentioned previously. The  only difference is that this indicator excludes the biogenic carbon  content by following a certain methodology.
