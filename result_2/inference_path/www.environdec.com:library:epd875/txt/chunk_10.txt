# Product Description  

Sanitaryware is the generic term used to describe items which traditionally  were made from pottery. i.e. WCâ€™s, Washbasins and Bidets installed within  a bathroom or washroom. Vitreous China (VC) is a common material used  for bathroom sanitaryware, such as console sinks and toilets. Vitreous  China sanitaryware products are primarily made of clay, kaolin, feldspar  and quartz but they may also include small quantities of other raw  materials. Its high gloss, stain resistant surface is ideal for use in both bath- rooms and kitchens. The casting slip is made of the above craw materials  are prepared and cast into plaster moulds to form a green body. The green  body then undergoes a natural drying process and were given a smooth  finish. Glazing is applied before firing at  $1200^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$  to obtain Vitreous China  sanitaryware with almost no water absorption. In fine fireclay, (FFC) the  pre-fired or calcined clay is the single most important component and can  account for over $40\%$  of the body. Other constituents include clay, kaolin  and other minor raw materials. Their production starts with preparation  of casting slip from the above constituents. The slip is cast into plaster  moulds to form green body. The green body then undergoes a natural  drying process and were given a smooth finish before tuner dryers. Glazing  is applied before firing at  $1220^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$ to obtain fire clay sanitaryware with  water absorption less than $0.5\%$  of the dry weight.
