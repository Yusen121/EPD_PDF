# LCA Modelling, Calculation and Data Quality  

are given in the LCA result tables. All energy calculations were  obtained using Cumulative Energy Demand (LHV) methodology,  while freshwater use is calculated with selected inventory flows in  SimaPro according to the PCR. There are no co-product allocations  within the LCA study underlying this EPD. The regional energy  datasets were used for all energy calculations.  

# Period Under Review  

The data used for LCA study concerns the year 2022.
