Tarkett operates with the utmost respect for the environment towards the realization of eco-friendly  products.  

Tarkettâ€™s commitment to the environment is woven throughout its business. Cradle-to-Cradle principles  are, in fact, the basis of the design and production of every solution. Particularly, the lifecycle analysis  is used to continuously improve the production process, and so the products until their use stage,  disposal and recycling. The development of products that can be reused within internal production  cycles, or external ones in case of other individuals, has been an integral part of the business strategy  aimed at sustainability for many years. The WCM (World Class Manufacturing) management system  has been developed in 2009, and it includes the environmental pillar aimed to the elimination of losses  and to the growth of process efficiency.
