# End of Life  

Our circular approach to carpet tiles enables us to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases like  carbon dioxide, a major contributor to global warming. Tarkett has implemented a take-back and  recycling program called ReStart 6 . Via Tarkett’s Sales Network and with the help of logistic partners,  post-use carpet tiles are collected and returned to Tarkett’s carpet recycling centre in Waalwijk, the  Netherlands 7 . DESSO’s EcoBase products have been designed with disassembly and recycling in  mind, which allows for recovery of yarn and backing materials in a closed-cycle and without loss of  quality. The recycling process 8  is developed by Tarkett and unique in the market.  

The only carpet tile manufacturer with a closed-loop recycling system, we limit the use of virgin raw  materials for new products, and avoid common, carbon-emitting options such as incineration and the  landfill at product end-of-life.
