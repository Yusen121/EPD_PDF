# Transport  

Carpets are recycled in the same factory where they are produced. So, the distance of transport between  installation sites and recycling site is the same as for the module A4 (average delivery distance to  customer).

# Waste processing  

Basically, the process separates yarn and EcoBase $\circledast$  backing and makes these main material streams  available for the next carpet cycle, without loss of value and/or material properties (closed-loop  recycling).  

A small rest stream (mainly tuft cloth and SBR-compound) cannot be reused yet at the desired quality  level. At this moment in time those streams will be considered as fuels and raw material (chalk and  ATH) for the cement industry, until other outlets will be found.
