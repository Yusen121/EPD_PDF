# Variability of LCA results  

The declared environmental impacts are the impacts of the worst case product. The data was  collected for the two sites of production. The variability of the results was calculated by doing a  sensitivity analysis as recommended by the EN $15804{+}\mathsf{A}2/\mathsf{C}\mathsf{N}$ .  

Variation of environmental impacts for all indicators greater than  $10\%$  for A1-C modules
