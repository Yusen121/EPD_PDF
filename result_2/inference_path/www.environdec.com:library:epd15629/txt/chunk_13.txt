# Results of the environmental performance indicators  

The estimated impact results are only relative statements which do not indicate the end points of the  impact categories, exceeding threshold values, safety margins or risks.  

All results are calculated on the declared unit, which is 1 tonne of studied product in this study.

To be noted, the contribution of the GWP-GHG from post-consumer materials of the HDPE foam product  is $34.87\%$  in A1-A3 stage. In particular, The GWP-GHG of secondary HDPE is  $0.654\;\mathsf{k g}\,\mathsf{C O}_{2}$ eq. per kg  material. They are bought from the third parties and the environmental burden from the waste material  of last life cycle to the ready-to-use secondary material is considered.
