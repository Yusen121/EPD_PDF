# Construction Process Stage  

A4:  This stage is relevant to the transportation of the final product from the  factory gate to the customers.  

A5.  This stage includes the adhesive mortar and water usage in the  construction site. For  $1\;{\mathsf{m}}^{2}$  slab installation;  $3.3~\mathrm{kg}$  mortar and  $0.8~\mathsf{L}$  water  usage was assumed.  

B1:  Ceramic tile do not cause any emissions in the use stage because of the  inert feature. B2:  Usage of detergent containing stain remover or neutral lowsulphate and  rinsing with tap water after cleaning was assumed. $0.2\,\mathsf{m L}$  detergent and 0.1  L water use was assumed to wash $1\,\mathsf{m}^{2}$  ceramic tile. B3-B5:  Ceramic tile do not require any repairment during the use phase and  therefore no impacts should be declared. B6-B7:  Ceramic tile do not require any water and energy in the use phase and  therefore no impacts ocurred in this module.
