8SYSTEM BOUNDARYA1: Raw Material SupplyProduction starts with raw materials. Raw material stage includes raw material extraction/preparation and pre-treatment processes before production.A2: Transportation Transport is relevant for delivery of raw materials and other materials to the plant and the transport of materials within the plant. Transport of raw materials to production site is taken as the weight average values for transport from supplier for the year of 2022. This EPDâ€™s system boundary is cradle to grave. The results of the LCA with the indicators as per EPD requirement are given in the following tables for product manufacture (A1, A2, A3), construction process stage (A4). According to EN 15804+A2:2019 standard, if the product or material is physically integrated with other products duringinstallation then they cannot be physically separated at the end of life stage. For this reason, modules C1-C4 and Module D are excluded.(X= Included in LCA, ND= Not Declared, NR= Not Related)
