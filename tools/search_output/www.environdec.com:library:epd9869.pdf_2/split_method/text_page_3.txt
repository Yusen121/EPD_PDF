The EPD owner has the sole ownership, liability, and responsibility for the EPD. EPDs within the same product category but from
different programmes may not be comparable. EPDs of construction products may not be comparable if they do not comply with
EN 15804.
EPDs within the same product category but registered in different EPD programmes, or not compliant with EN 15804, may not
be comparable. For two EPDs to be comparable, they must be based on the same PCR (including the same version number)
or be based on fully-aligned PCRs or versions of PCRs; cover products with identical functions, technical performances and use
(e.g. identical declared/functional units); have equivalent system boundaries and descriptions of data; apply equivalent data
quality requirements, methods of data collection, and allocation methods; apply identical cut-off rules and impact assessment
methods (including the same version of characterisation factors); have equivalent content declarations; and be valid at the time of
comparison. For further information about comparability, see EN 15804 and ISO 14025.
