It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.Disclaimer 2The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high or as there is limited experienced with the indicator.
