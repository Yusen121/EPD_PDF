# Delivery and installation  

# Delivery  

The average distribution distance between the factories and the installation site is presented in the  following table. The distribution is made by truck.

# Installation  

Carpet flooring do not use any electric tools for their installation. If a cut is necessary, it could be done  with a manual tool.  

# Waste  

During the installation approximately $3\%$  of the flooring is lost as off-cuts. All flooring losses are sent to  incineration.  

# Packaging  

$50\%$  of the packaging materials goes to incineration and  $50\%$  goes to landfill except for wooden pallet  which are recycled.  

# Use Stage  

# Reference Service Life (RSL)  

For this product, the stated RSL is 1 year. It should be noted, however, that the service life of a carpet  flooring may vary depending on the amount and nature of floor traffic and the type and frequency of  maintenance. The manufacturer has provided this service life on the basis of his experience of flooring  manufacture and supply. This RSL is applicable as long as the product use complies with that defined  by ISO 14041 and ISO 10874 in accordance with the product’s classification. The service lifetime  recommended by Tarkett is 10 years.  

# Cleaning and maintenance  

The maintenance step concerns the cleaning of the floor. Tarkett has provided the recommended  maintenance routine for the product throughout the reference life. Water, detergent and electricity  consumption of the cleaning machine are considered in the LCA study:  

•   Common maintenance: 2 times / week  •   Periodical maintenance: 2 times / year

# Prevention of structural damage  

To avoid excessive wear, usage should be restricted to the stated areas of application as outlined by  the norm ISO 10874.  

# End of Life  

Our circular approach to carpet tiles enables us to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases like  carbon dioxide, a major contributor to global warming. Tarkett has implemented a take-back and  recycling program called ReStart 6 . Via Tarkett’s Sales Network and with the help of logistic partners,  post-use carpet tiles are collected and returned to Tarkett’s carpet recycling centre in Waalwijk, the  Netherlands 7 . DESSO’s EcoBase products have been designed with disassembly and recycling in  mind, which allows for recovery of yarn and backing materials in a closed-cycle and without loss of  quality. The recycling process 8  is developed by Tarkett and unique in the market.  

The only carpet tile manufacturer with a closed-loop recycling system, we limit the use of virgin raw  materials for new products, and avoid common, carbon-emitting options such as incineration and the  landfill at product end-of-life.  

# Transport  

Carpets are recycled in the same factory where they are produced. So, the distance of transport between  installation sites and recycling site is the same as for the module A4 (average delivery distance to  customer).  

![](images/e924cff97f5c8e248fe73df90231d67e71ab36a0bfc7c6068b66a4293fea3184.jpg)  

# Waste processing  

Basically, the process separates yarn and EcoBase ®  backing and makes these main material streams  available for the next carpet cycle, without loss of value and/or material properties (closed-loop  recycling).  

A small rest stream (mainly tuft cloth and SBR-compound) cannot be reused yet at the desired quality  level. At this moment in time those streams will be considered as fuels and raw material (chalk and  ATH) for the cement industry, until other outlets will be found.  

# Resource recovery  

Module D has been considered for this study in order to evaluate the possible environmental benefits  obtainable through the re-use of secondary materials in other production cycles. Particularly, the  module clearly describes the benefits and the environmental charges deriving from reusable products  exiting from the system, such as secondary materials or secondary fuels.  

Three outlets have been considered:  

•   Yarn  •   DESSO EcoBase ®  backing  •   Others compounds  

PA6 yarn will be sent to Tarkett’s yarn supplier Aquafil for de polymerization and reuse in new carpet  yarns. This post-use material stream can be used for  $100\%$  and without quality loss for the production  of new carpet yarns.  

DESSO EcoBase ®  backing is  $100\%$  recyclable in Tarkett’s own production process. Post-use material  can be directly recovered in Tarkett’s production for the same purpose and avoids the production and  use of primary material.  

A small rest fraction is recycled in the cement industry. The chalk and ATH content substitutes primary  chalk, which is a raw material for the production of cement. Organic residues substitute primary fuel for  processing.  

# Interpretation of results  

The environmental impact of DESSO EcoBase products should be considered over the whole life  cycle and beyond, including all module A-D. DESSO EcoBase consists of a novel recipe, specially  designed to enable post-consumer recycling on a high level, which means, for the same purpose and  without quality loss.  

The original EcoBase backing was introduced in 2010. Because of the relatively long service life-time  (10 years), the majority of current products are still in their first cycle, meaning that recycled content is  still very minimal and not included in the calculations.

Information on biogenic carbon content

Note: 1 kg biogenic carbon is equivalent to 44/12 kg  $C O_{2}.$ .  

# Additional mandatory and voluntary impact category indicators  

This indicator accounts for all greenhouse gases except biogenic carbon dioxide uptake and  emissions and biogenic carbon stored in the product. As such, the indicator is identical to GWP-total  except that the CF for biogenic CO2 is set to zero.  

# Differences compared to previous EPD  

Data from an improved EcoBase backing have been integrated in the calculations. This improvement  means the replacement of a fossil-based ingredient for a bio-based ingredient.   Also, production data from a more recent year (2022) has been integrated in the calculations.
