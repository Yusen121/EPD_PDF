Vitreous  China sanitaryware products are primarily made of clay, kaolin, feldspar  and quartz but they may also include small quantities of other raw  materials.

Kaleseramik sources raw materials from different  locations across Turkey and other parts of the world and by different  means of transport (truck and ship). For this reason, transport was  allocated according to tonnages for almost all raw materials bought  by Kaleseramik. Kaleseramik manufactures various ceramic products  in the Company’s Çanakkale plant in Turkey. Electricity and combined  heat power (CHP) powered by natural gas are used. Raw materials,  transport, packaging, waste, and energy consumption data were  allocated for each product using related production tonnages from  Kaleseramik’s Çanakkale plant for the average product.
