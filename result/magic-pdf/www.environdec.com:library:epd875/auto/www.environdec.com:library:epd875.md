# How To Read This EPD?  

An Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) is an ISO Type III  Environmental Declaration based on ISO 14025 standard. An EPD  transparently reports the environmental performance of products  or services from a lifecycle perspective. The preparation of an EPD  includes different stages, from acquiring raw materials to the end  of life of the final product/service. EPDs are based on international  standards and consider the entire value chain. Additionally,  EPD is  a third-party verified document . This EPD includes the following  sections described below.  

# 1. General and Program Information  

The first part of an EPD has information about the name of the  manufacturer and product/service and other general information  such as the validity and expiration dates of the document, the name  of the program operator, geographical scope, etc. The second page  states the standards followed and gives information about the  program operator, third-party verifier, etc. The followed Product  Category Rule (PCR) is indicated on the second page.  

# 2. Company and Product/Service Information  

Information about the company and the investigated product is  given in this section. It summarizes the characteristics of the product  provided by the manufacturer. It also includes information about  the product such as product composition and packaging.  

# 3. LCA Information  

Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) information is one of the most important  parts of the EPD as it describes the functional/declared unit, time  representative ness of the study, database(s) and LCA software,  along with system boundaries. The table presented in this part has  columns for each stage in the life cycle. The considered stages are  marked  $\mathbf{\acute{X}}^{\prime}$  whereas the ones that are not considered are labeled  as ‘NR’ (Not Relevant). Not all EPDs consider the full life cycle  assessment for a product’s entire life stages. The ‘System Boundary’  page is also the place where one can find detailed information about  the stages and the assumptions made.  

# 4. LCA Results  

The results of the LCA analysis are presented in table format. The  first column in each table indicates the name of the impact category  and their measurement units are presented in the second column.  These tables show an amount at each life cycle stage to see the  impact of different indicators on different stages. Each impact can  be understood as what is released through the production of the  declared unit of the material. The benefits of reuse/recycling of the  declared product are reflected in this section.  

The first impact in the table is global warming potential (GWP),  which shows how much  $\mathsf{C}\mathsf{O}_{2}$  is released at each stage. Other  impacts include eutrophication potential, acidification potential,  ozone layer depletion, land use related impacts, etc. The second  table provides results for resource use and the third table is about  the waste produced during production. The fourth and final table  shows the results for the GWP-GHG indicator, which is almost  equivalent to the GWP-Total indicator mentioned previously. The  only difference is that this indicator excludes the biogenic carbon  content by following a certain methodology.

# About Product  

# Product Description  

Sanitaryware is the generic term used to describe items which traditionally  were made from pottery. i.e. WC’s, Washbasins and Bidets installed within  a bathroom or washroom. Vitreous China (VC) is a common material used  for bathroom sanitaryware, such as console sinks and toilets. Vitreous  China sanitaryware products are primarily made of clay, kaolin, feldspar  and quartz but they may also include small quantities of other raw  materials. Its high gloss, stain resistant surface is ideal for use in both bath- rooms and kitchens. The casting slip is made of the above craw materials  are prepared and cast into plaster moulds to form a green body. The green  body then undergoes a natural drying process and were given a smooth  finish. Glazing is applied before firing at  $1200^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$  to obtain Vitreous China  sanitaryware with almost no water absorption. In fine fireclay, (FFC) the  pre-fired or calcined clay is the single most important component and can  account for over $40\%$  of the body. Other constituents include clay, kaolin  and other minor raw materials. Their production starts with preparation  of casting slip from the above constituents. The slip is cast into plaster  moulds to form green body. The green body then undergoes a natural  drying process and were given a smooth finish before tuner dryers. Glazing  is applied before firing at  $1220^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$ to obtain fire clay sanitaryware with  water absorption less than $0.5\%$  of the dry weight.

![](images/bd4e6a0b7aab147ec8df56247c52f5fff1c909acd2a6dacc26b7f59a695743a0.jpg)  

# Construction Process Stage  

A4:  This stage is relevant to the transportation of the final product from the  factory gate to the customers.  

A5.  This stage includes the adhesive mortar and water usage in the  construction site. For 1 tonne sanitaryware installation;  $150~\mathsf{k g}$  mortar and  $25~\mathsf{k g}$  plastic usage was assumed.  

# Use Stage  

B1:  Sanitaryware do not cause any emissions in the use stage because of the  inert feature.  

B2:  Usage of detergent containing stain remover or neutral lowsulphate and  rinsing with tap water after cleaning was assumed. 2,5 L detergent and 5 L  water use was assumed to wash 1 tonne sanitaryware.  

B3-B5:  Sanitaryware do not require any repairment during the use phase and  therefore no impacts should be declared.  

B6-B7:  Sanitaryware do not require any water and energy in the use phase  and therefore no impacts ocurred in this module.  

# End of Life Stage  

C1:  Deconstruction of sanitaryware at the end of their life is done manually.  So no impact occurs in this module.   C2:  Waste transport includes discarded sanitaryware and mortar to disposal  area. Distance from demolition site to inert landfill site for final disposal is  assumed as $50\,\mathsf{k m}$ . C3:  Environmental impacts generated during the crushing of discarded  sanitaryware before recycle or reuse. C4.  Disposal construction and demolition waste scenario is created separately  depending on the geographic location of the use phase. After domestic usage,  ceramic sanitaryware products end up at construction and demolition waste  landfills as their final fate and modelled as such in the LCA. D:  Inert filler benefits and recycling of packaging materials specified in the  disposal stage.

# Cut-off Rules  

For this LCA study, no cut-off criteria was applied.  

# Background Data  

For all LCA modelling and calculation, Ecoinvent database (v3.9) and  SimaPro (v9.5) LCA software were used.  

# LCA Modelling, Calculation and Data Quality  

are given in the LCA result tables. All energy calculations were  obtained using Cumulative Energy Demand (LHV) methodology,  while freshwater use is calculated with selected inventory flows in  SimaPro according to the PCR. There are no co-product allocations  within the LCA study underlying this EPD. The regional energy  datasets were used for all energy calculations.  

# Period Under Review  

The data used for LCA study concerns the year 2022.  

# Allocations  

There are no co-products in the production of ceramic sanitaryware  manufactured by Kaleseramik. Hence, there was no need for co- product allocation. Kaleseramik sources raw materials from different  locations across Turkey and other parts of the world and by different  means of transport (truck and ship). For this reason, transport was  allocated according to tonnages for almost all raw materials bought  by Kaleseramik. Kaleseramik manufactures various ceramic products  in the Company’s Çanakkale plant in Turkey. Electricity and combined  heat power (CHP) powered by natural gas are used. Raw materials,  transport, packaging, waste, and energy consumption data were  allocated for each product using related production tonnages from  Kaleseramik’s Çanakkale plant for the average product.
