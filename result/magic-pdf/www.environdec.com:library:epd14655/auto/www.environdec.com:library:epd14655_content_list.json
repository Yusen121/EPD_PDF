The mixed aggregates enter a rotating  dryer drum, where the materials are dried and heated to the required temperature. The heated material  continues to an elevator and is further transported up to the batch tower. Then dry and hot aggregates  are screened and separated according to particle size and put into a weight hopper. The dry aggregates  are mixed with bitumen, filler, fibres and other additives in the mixing chamber.
