# Manufacturing processes:  

As the manufacturing process is important to understand the whole studied system, the description of  the main manufacturing processes for producing the studied product is explained as below. A flow chart  of product manufacturing is shown below.  

![](images/47c773988e9408a78e77c7aa69bf8159df3fe2899e95e9fe595a1e38738d4591.jpg)  
Figure 1 The main production process of studied product.  

Polyethylene wood-like foam board product is made of secondary HDPE plastic as the main raw material,  and then add foaming agent, conditioning agent and other additives, and then made into all kinds of  specifications of foam profiles through the process of granulation and extrusion.  

The GWP-GHG of electricity mix for Zhejiang province in this study is 0.807 kg CO 2  eq./kWh. Note that  the Guarantees of Origin market in China represents an extremely small proportion of production and  consumption, and therefore the consumption mix is effectively the same as the residual mix.  

Table 2. Electricity structure of the Zhejiang province and the dataset chosen for it  
![](images/5905131ad2c364fe4a942afa64c64cf838f2e937324d01147eea075d82116ab7.jpg)  

(1)  In the 2022 China Electricity Yearbook, the percentage of electricity from fossil fuel for each province is not specified.  A brief description of electricity from fossil fuel for the whole country is given in the yearbook, i.e. it covers coal, gas,  oil, biomass, and a small amount of unidentified sources for generating electricity. Based on the information in the  yearbook, i.e., electricity from hard coal accounts for more than  $80\%$  of the thermal power generation types, and  considering that China is a country where coal-fired power generation is the main source of thermal power generation,  the LCA practitioner (IVL) decide to use electricity from hard coal as  $100\%$  of the dataset selection for electricity from  fossil fuel in this study for modelling.  

# More information:  

Scenarios and additional technical information:  

   The product is manufactured in China, and the waste treatment of the waste generated during the  manufacturing process was included in the system boundary.  

   The product is sent to and used globally. For the A4 module, the longest shipping distance is  applied for the model as the conservative consideration, which is selling to the United States. The  specific data of the longest transportation information from the manufacturing plants to the  overseas selling destination is collected by the client, which is the specific data.  

   With regard to module A5, during the construction stage, the product requires some screws, which  are included in the study. The energy consumption of the construction, i.e., electricity, is included  in the study. Besides, according to the information provided by the client, the packaging of the  studied products is assumed to become to waste in this stage and is treated to end-of-life stage.    

    In module B, the product in this study do not generate emissions and consume energy and water  during the whole use phase, so the use phase environmental impact is deemed to be zero.  

   The modelling of module C1 is assumed that the consumption of additional materials and energy  used in the deconstruction stage for installation is zero. The  $76\%$  of the rest of the waste product  would be sent to C4 for disposal, and ${\mathcal{2}}4\%$  to energy recovery according to the data from the United  States Environmental Protection Agency, which is based on A4 scenario setting. For module C2,  conservative assumptions have been made that the waste product would be transported for 500  km by truck. For the waste processing module C3, disposal module C4, and module D (benefits  and loads beyond the system boundary), the generic data has been applied.  

   Regarding the module D calculation, since the product has post-consumer materials as the raw  material, all post-consumer materials are substrated from output flows in the calculation of the  benefit to avoid the double counting of the benefit. Meanwhile, this study does not consider the co- product allocation in this project, so there is no co-product allocation issue for the module D  calculation.  

# Allocation:  

Allocation rules for co-products are mentioned in the PCR. In this study, there are no co-products  produced. No co-product allocation has been applied in this study i.e. all burdens are allocated to the  final studied product. For the allocation of waste, module D calculation, and scarp, this study strictly  follows the PCR.  

For the post-consumer materials (secondary polymer), they are bought from the third parties and the  environmental burden from the waste material of last life cycle to the ready-to-use secondary material  is considered. In the end-of-life stage, the environmental impacts of the entire waste product are  considered (including the scarp contained therein), e.g., in the case of incineration, the environmental  impacts of all materials burned are considered. For the calculation of Module D, it only considered  environmental benefits from primary materials contained in the product, not calculated benefits from the  post-consumer material part.  

# Cut-off rules:  

The cut-off criteria established by the PCR is that data for elementary flows to and from the product  system contributing to a minimum of  $95\%$  of the declared environmental impacts shall be included (not  including processes that are explicitly outside the system boundary).  

This study strictly follows the cut-off rule. Raw materials with high environmental impacts were reserved  in calculation even though their mass is smaller than $5\%$  of the whole product. The cut-off rule is only  applied on auxiliary materials of the studied product. The total amount of cut-off materials in the product  system is fully below  $1\%$  and no high emission material is used for those materials. Besides, the  transportation of A3 manufacturing waste which are sent third-party for treatment is cut-off. The  sensitivity analysis is applied on the cut-off part to ensure the environmental impact of the cut-off part is  below $5\%$ .

At the time of data collection, no substance included in the Candidate List of Substances of Very High  Concern (SVHC) for authorization under the REACH Regulations is present in the products covered by  this LCA and EPD either above the threshold for registration with the European Chemicals Agency or  above $0.1\%$  (wt/wt).  

Depending on the PCR, in general, the production and end-of-life processes of infrastructure or capital  goods used in the product system should be excluded, unless there is evidence that they are relevant  in terms of their environmental impact, or when a generic LCI dataset includes infrastructure/capital  goods, and it is not possible, within reasonable effort, to subtract the data on infrastructure/capital goods  from this dataset (directly citation from section 4.3.2 of PCR 1.3.4). In this study, the infrastructure and  capital goods are not included in the LCA analysis since they are used plenty of times for several years  for the product manufacturing. According to the PCR, it should be excluded.  

All results in this LCA analysis are calculated by the EN  $15804{+}\mathsf{A}2$ .  The “EN 15804 reference package”  is calculated based on EF 3.1.  

# Results of the environmental performance indicators  

The estimated impact results are only relative statements which do not indicate the end points of the  impact categories, exceeding threshold values, safety margins or risks.  

All results are calculated on the declared unit, which is 1 tonne of studied product in this study.

To be noted, the contribution of the GWP-GHG from post-consumer materials of the HDPE foam product  is $34.87\%$  in A1-A3 stage. In particular, The GWP-GHG of secondary HDPE is  $0.654\;\mathsf{k g}\,\mathsf{C O}_{2}$ eq. per kg  material. They are bought from the third parties and the environmental burden from the waste material  of last life cycle to the ready-to-use secondary material is considered.
